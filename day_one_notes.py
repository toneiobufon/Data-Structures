#runtime complexity is a way to objectively measure and compare
# 
# 
# two runtime complexity 
# 
# complexity classes:
#    constant time: efficiendy does not depend on input size

#   linear time: efficiency is affected by size


#example of runtime complexity

# commands = ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']


#constant time
#time does not grow based on number of input

# commands[3] # size of input has no bearing on the efficiency of this operation

#linear time
#linear runtime grows 1:1 as the size of input increases 

# for command in commands:
#     print(command) #input size has direct bearing on efficiency

# Constant < Linear

# we are comparing how quickly the efficiency grows related to input size


#example of singly linked list below
